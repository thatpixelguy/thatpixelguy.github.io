<h2>Welcome!</h2>

<p>Hey, my name's Mike Burns, aka thepixelguy. I'm an undergrad student who does a little indie game development on the side. I'll probably throw some stuff up on this website for posterity, but if you want to keep track of my most recent stuff, <a href='https://twitter.com/thatpixelguy'>Twitter</a> is the place to go.</p>

<p>If you enjoy crazy hard old-school-style platformers, you might give <a href='http://kidtripp.com/'>Kid Tripp for iOS</a> a look! Nope, there isn't an Android version, but <a href='https://twitter.com/thatpixelguy/status/551903673786585088'>I'm currently working on a sequel</a> which will be 1) better and 2) released on everything under the sun. <i>(Except Android, muahaha!)</i></p>
